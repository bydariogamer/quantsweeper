# quantsweeper
This game is a quantic minesweeper in which players have no opportunity to win. But, it is fun however. Maybe in a next version it will be possible to have a h/4\*pi change of winning
# dependencies
This game works with python 3 and needs pygame module installed (so, there should be no OS problems with it).
# license
The game is under GPL. To sum up: it means you can do whatever you won't with the code as long as the rest of the people have the same freedom (read the LICENSE however).
All images are under CC-BY-SA: they can be shared, modified, and even sold as long as everybody have the same freedom to do what you did.
YES, you can make money of this piece of code (but it is not what the code is suposed to be for). I can't imagine someone buying such a silly game however.
